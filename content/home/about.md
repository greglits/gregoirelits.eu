# Biography

Welcome to my website. I am a researcher and lecturer in sociology, working at Université catholique de Louvain and affiliated to the [CriDIS] (https://uclouvain.be/fr/instituts-recherche/iacchos/cridis) research center. I hold a Ph.D. in Political and Social Sciences from UCLouvain (Belgium).

My research interests focus on political sociology, environmental sociology, science-democracy interface and social movement theory. I recently conducted research on Nuclear Waste Management in Belgium and the EU (Ph.D.), Gender inequalities in academic careers (GARCIA FP7 project), the europeanisation of social policies and the ’social investment perspective’ (Re-Invest H2020 project) and ageing policies in Wallonia (IWEPS funded project).

I am also the founder and director of Émulations a French speaking international social science journal founded in 2007 and funded (since 2017) by the Belgian National Science Foundation (FNRS).
