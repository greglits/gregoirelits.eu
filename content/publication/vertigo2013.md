abstract = "The career of the problem of nuclear waste management (NWM) is characterized by a major shift in the way decisions are made. The formulation of a technical solution does not appear to be sufficient anymore. Regulators need to address both the technical and the “societal aspects” of NWM. Subsequently, one observes the rising of a new consensus, namely that these “societal aspects” can only be properly handled by mobilizing the expertise of the social scientists. Collaboration between nuclear and social scientists is therefore called upon as a way to improve NWM. Based on a critical review of the literature available on the role of social scientists in the governance of nuclear technology, informed by an ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Belgium between 2009 and 2012, this article analyses the different roles that social scientists can actually play and the different ways through which their expertise can be mobilized for managing the “societal aspects” of NWM."
